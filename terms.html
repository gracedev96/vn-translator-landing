<h1 id="acceptance-of-terms">Acceptance of Terms</h1>
<p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) form a binding agreement between Ngoc Le  and you regarding your use of the VN Translator application and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By installing, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>
<h1 id="description-of-the-service">Description of the Service</h1>
<p>The <strong>VN Translator App</strong> enables you to translate text that appears on your screen, or from other sources such as manual input, speech, clipboard. It may use on-device text recognition <strong>Apple’s Vision Framework</strong>, <strong>Google ML Kit Text Recognition</strong> and connect to translation services to return translated text. The app may display advertising (<strong>Google AdMob</strong>), collect usage analytics (<strong>Google Analytics for Firebase</strong>), and gather crash diagnostics (<strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Important privacy promise:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> collect or save your screenshots, screencasts, clipboard or other text content. Only the <strong>extracted text</strong> needed for translation is processed (see Privacy Policy for details).</p>
<h1 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h1>
<p>You must be capable of forming a binding contract and comply with applicable laws. If you are under the age required by your local law to consent to data processing or to use apps (e.g., 13 or 16), you may use the Service only with valid parental/guardian consent.</p>
