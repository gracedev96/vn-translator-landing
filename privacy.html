<h1 id="core-privacy-principles">Core Privacy Principles</h1>
<p>•  <strong>No screen media collection:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> collect or save your screenshots, screencasts, or other on-screen content.
•  <strong>Only extracted text is used:</strong> The Service processes only the <strong>text extracted</strong> from your screen content for translation. We do not store this text beyond what is necessary to return results or operate the Service, unless you explicitly save it (e.g., favorites/history you choose to keep).</p>
<h1 id="information-we-process">Information We Process</h1>
<h2 id="on-device-content-processing">On-Device Content Processing</h2>
<p>•  <strong>Images/video frames of your screen</strong> may be processed <strong>on your device</strong> to detect text (e.g., via <strong>Google ML Kit Text Recognition</strong>).
•  <strong>We do not upload or store</strong> your screenshots/screencasts on our servers.
•  The <strong>extracted text</strong> may be sent to translation services solely to deliver the translation result (see “Third-Party Services” below).</p>
<h2 id="usage-diagnostics">Usage &amp; Diagnostics</h2>
<p>•  We may collect <strong>app usage</strong> and performance data (e.g., session counts, feature usage, device type, app version) through <strong>Google Analytics for Firebase</strong> to improve the Service.
•  We collect <strong>crash logs and stability data</strong> via <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> to diagnose and fix issues. Crash data can include device and event data around the time of the crash.</p>
<h2 id="advertising-data">Advertising Data</h2>
<p>•  If the app shows ads via <strong>Google AdMob</strong>, advertising SDKs may collect <strong>mobile ad identifiers</strong> (e.g., AAID/IDFA), <strong>approximate location</strong>, IP address, and similar signals to deliver and measure ads (including personalized ads if enabled).</p>
<h2 id="optional-user-data-you-provide">Optional User Data You Provide</h2>
<p>•  If you contact support or opt in to certain features (e.g., saving translation history, subscription issues), we may receive your <strong>email</strong>, <strong>feedback</strong>, or the data you explicitly choose to save.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect sensitive categories of personal data unless you provide them voluntarily (e.g., in a support email). Please avoid sharing sensitive information.</p>
<h1 id="how-we-use-information">How We Use Information</h1>
<p>•  <strong>Provide the Service:</strong> perform on-device text recognition; send extracted text to translation providers; display results.

•  <strong>Advertising (if applicable):</strong> show ads and measure effectiveness.
•  <strong>Communicate:</strong> respond to support inquiries and notify you of important changes.

<h1 id="third-party-services-sdks-processors-">Third-Party Services (SDKs &amp; Processors)</h1>
<p>We use third parties to power specific features. These providers process data under their own privacy policies and may act as independent controllers for some activities:
Here are the link to the privacy policy of third-party services providers used by the app:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google AdMob</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>

</ul>
<h1 id="data-retention">Data Retention</h1>
<p>•  <strong>Extracted Text:</strong> kept only transiently to return translation results, unless you explicitly save it (e.g., in local history you choose to keep).
•  <strong>Analytics &amp; Crash Data:</strong> retained according to provider default settings and our configuration for troubleshooting and app improvement.
•  <strong>Support Communications:</strong> retained as needed to handle your request and for recordkeeping.</p>
<h1 id="data-security">Data Security</h1>
<p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect information. No system is perfectly secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<h1 id="international-transfers">International Transfers</h1>
<p>If you use the Service from outside the country where our servers or providers are located, your information may be processed in other countries with different data protection laws. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards.</p>

<p>•  <strong>Ads personalization:</strong> You can limit personalized ads in your device settings (e.g., “Reset/Limit Ad Personalization” on Android/iOS).
•  <strong>Analytics/Crash reporting:</strong> If the app offers settings to disable analytics or crash reporting, you can use them; otherwise, you may limit data at the OS level.
•  <strong>Access, deletion, correction:</strong> Depending on your region (e.g., GDPR/UK GDPR/CCPA/CPRA), you may have rights to access, delete, or correct personal information, and to object or restrict certain processing. To exercise rights, contact vntranslator2025@gmail.com. We may ask for verification.</p>
